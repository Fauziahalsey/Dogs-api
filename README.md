# Random Dog Image API Retrieval
This Python script allows you to retrieve a random dog image from the Dog API. It uses the Dog API to fetch an image of an adorable dog, providing you with a delightful dose of canine cuteness.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
The requests library installed. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install requests
```
Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the script file (random_dog.py) to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Run the script using the following command:
```
python random_dog.py
```
## Usage
The script sends a GET request to the Dog API to fetch a random dog image.

It checks if the response status code is 200, which indicates a successful request to the API.

If the response status code is 200, it attempts to parse the JSON response, which contains information about the dog image.

If parsing is successful, it prints the JSON content in a human-readable format.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the script or the API response, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Verify that you have an active internet connection.
Check the API documentation (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to ensure you are using the correct endpoint and request parameters.
Inspect the printed response content to see the details of the dog image and any potential error messages.
